<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Film Vault, our React-powered app, offers a streamlined way to track and rate your watched movies. Organize your cinematic adventures effortlessly in a secure digital vault, creating a personalized archive of your favorite films. With a user-friendly interface, Film Vault not only simplifies movie management but also integrates IMDb ratings, letting you see how others have rated the same films. Dive into a curated movie experience that combines your preferences with the collective insights of the IMDb community.



Key Features:

1. Effortless Movie Tracking: Utilizing a single-page app design principle, Film Vault provides a seamless and responsive user interface, offering an elegant and friendly feel for effortless movie tracking.

2. Secure Local Storage: Film Vault leverages your browser's local storage, ensuring a secure and convenient way to store your watched list and ratings. This allows you to revisit and update your movie records at any time without the need for an external account.

3. Automatic Rating Insights: Film Vault calculates and displays your average rating for your watched list. It also fetches the average IMDb user rating from the RESTful API OMDb, providing valuable insights for easy comparisons and a deeper understanding of your cinematic preferences.


Enhance your projects effortlessly with our React StarRating Component. As a small but impactful side offering, we've crafted a dedicated API file that you can seamlessly download from our source code. This allows you to integrate our sleek star rating system directly into your React applications, bringing a touch of Film Vault's user-friendly design to your own projects. Elevate your UI effortlessly with our downloadable React Component, making cinematic flair a seamless addition to your development toolkit.

Enhancing the user experience, Film Vault dynamically updates the document title with each selected movie, seamlessly achieved through the power of the useEffect hook. As you navigate through the movie list, the title of the document dynamically reflects the currently selected movie, offering a personalized touch to your cinematic journey. This subtle yet impactful feature ensures that each movie takes center stage, creating an immersive and tailored experience for every user interaction within the application

Originally conceived as a course project, Film Vault has evolved into a personalized movie tracking experience that now reflects my unique style and preferences. While its inception may have been part of an academic journey, I've transformed the app by infusing it with a carefully curated color palette and minor details to align with my aesthetic vision.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Installation

**LIVE DEMO [HERE](https://cooksta.netlify.app/)**

**Since the application's data resides on MongoDB Atlas, you'll require the connection URL to access the database. However, as the URL contains my account's password, for security reasons, I haven't included the db_connection.py file. If you wish to host it locally, please reach out to me via LinkedIn, and I'll assist you in obtaining your own db_connection.py**

Once you've obtained db_connection.py, you can follow these next steps

1. Click the green button

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84189062/210023644-49f6ee47-b8aa-479d-b192-c9985ef913cd.png)
   
   
2. Download ZIP

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84189062/210023664-4d06ef4a-71a7-444d-9778-bf21c8ed30ae.png)
  
  
3. Extract the file
   ```sh
   Make sure all of the files are in the same folder!!!
   ```

4. Paste the db_connection.py file into the "backend" folder

5. Go into the "backend" folder
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```

6. Create a virtual environment and activate it
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   . .venv/Scripts/activate
   ```
   Some systems might be different (python3 rather python; . .venv/bin/activate rather than . .venv/Scripts/activate)

7. Install backend dependencies 
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

7. Run the server
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   In the terminal, you'll see a link, but it's not for the actual app. It's just for the backend server, so please refrain from clicking on it.

8. Open up a new terminal and cd into the "frontend" folder
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
   
9. Install frontend dependencies
   ```sh
   npm i
   ```

10. Run frontend server
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
  You'll find a link in the terminal. Hold down Control and left-click on the link to access it. Enjoy!
